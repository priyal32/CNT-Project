# CNT-Project

Locally
- Currenlty using files peerProcess, peerServer, peerClient, Handshake, Peer 
- Use localPeerInfo.cfg instead of PeerInfo.cfg
- Run peerProcess with 1001 as argument as that's first peer process then run 1002 in another window then 1003 and so on
- Can configure multiple instances to run in intellij. Run with different arguments each time
